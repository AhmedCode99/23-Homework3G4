# Tentative Idea of HW3G4 Task
Our main intention in this task will be like;
- We will first convert a list of velocities from miles per hour to meters per second using the map function and the lambda           function "convert_to_mps". 
- We define a generator function "calculate_work_done" that calculates the work done at each point along the way by calculating the   change in kinetic energy.
- The generator yields the work done at each point.
- Finally, we iterate through the generator to calculate the work done at each point and accumulate it to find the overall work       done.
